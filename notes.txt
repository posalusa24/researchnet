## Part â€“ A Designing the network

Topology used

The network architecture follows Cisco's recommendation of a traditional 3-tier hierarchical network architecture.
It is a design framework used to create scalable, modular, and efficient network infrastructures.

The hierarchy consists of these layers:

* access layer: The bottom layer of the hierarchy, closest to end-user devices.
Responsible for connecting end-user devices such as computers, phones, and printers to the network.
* distribution layer: The middle layer that acts as an aggregation point for traffic from the access layer and provides routing, filtering, and policy-based connectivity.
* core layer: The topmost layer responsible for high-speed, high-capacity forwarding of data.

This allows for the following benefits in our network:

    Scalability: Allows for the easy addition of access switches and devices in the access layer without impacting core and distribution layers.

    Modularity: Each layer performs specific functions, making it easier to upgrade or replace components without affecting the entire network.

    Hierarchical Design: Provides a clear separation of duties between layers, improving network organization and troubleshooting capabilities.

    Redundancy: The architecture supports redundancy and fault tolerance, ensuring network reliability.

    Security: Security policies can be implemented at multiple levels, including the access layer, to control user access and network traffic.

    Optimized Traffic Flow: Optimizes the flow of network traffic, reducing unnecessary traffic between layers.

Cisco's three-tier hierarchical network architecture is widely used in enterprise networks and data centers to create robust and scalable network infrastructures capable of meeting the demands of modern businesses and applications.

In addition, our network is has a fully-meshed star topology, with redundant links and aggregated ports. By meshing at least two of the same device type, we can ensure operation when one device goes down.
